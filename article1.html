    <h1>Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED)</h1>

    <h6>Introduction</h6>
    <p>Over time, there has been increased pressure on the development of ‘green buildings’ or sustainable buildings within our environment [1]. The word ‘green’ is known to be associated with sustainability and environmental conservation but there
      is no formal definition of what makes a ‘green building’. However, EPA [2], defines green building as: ‘a practice of creating structures and using processes that are environmentally responsible and resource-efficient throughout a building's
      life-cycle from siting to design, construction, operation, maintenance, renovation, and deconstruction. This practice expands and complements the classical building design concerns of economy, utility, durability, and comfort. Green building is
      also known as a sustainable or high performance building’. In summary, the term ‘green building’ focuses on the creation of sustainable buildings.

      In order to ascertain how green a building is, the United States Green Building Council (USGBC) decided to introduce a certification system that would focus on obtaining information and ranking the performance of a building in terms of its
      location, energy, atmosphere, indoor environmental quality, design process and materials used for the building. In 2000, the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification was introduced by the USGBC as a green building
      certification label and has grown in popularity ever since. LEED is a rating system available for all building types and is a comprehensive path to creating buildings that are resource and energy efficient.
    </p>
    <h6>Importance of LEED</h6>
    <p>According to research, LEED certified buildings have been proven to be better for the environment, water and energy efficient, as well as healthier and safer for occupants thereby making these buildings a lot more attractive to tenants than
      buildings without certification. In Canada alone, it has been recorded that 30% of greenhouse gas comes from buildings, 35% of landfill waste comes from construction and demolition activities and about 70% of metropolitan water is consumed in
      and around buildings [3]. This goes to show how much waste buildings produce and how important it is to work towards reducing these numbers. Since the introduction of LEED to Canada in 2004, the following has been done:
    </p>
    <p>1. Energy savings of up to 16.7 Million MWh which is enough to power 570,000 homes in Canada for a full year [3]</p>
    <p>2. Water savings of more than 30 billion litres which is equivalent to the amount that courses over the Niagara Falls in four hours [3]</p>
    <p>3. Recycling over 3.6 million tonnes of construction/demolition waste which is British Columbia’s total waste disposal in a year [3]</p>
    <p>4. GHG reduction: A 3.24 million CO2e tonne reduction in greenhouse gas emissions which equates to taking 690,000 cars off the road for a year [3]</p>
    <p>5. Green roofs: 355,000 square metres of green roof enough to green the length of the Don Valley Parkway in Toronto. [3]</p>

    <h6>LEED rating system </h6>
    <p>The LEED rating system measures how efficient or how ‘green’ a building is and so, the more efficient a building is, the more points it will merit. The newly updated version of the LEED certification contains nine prerequisites (six of which
      are mandatory) which has a total of 110 points to gain certification. The nine categories are Integrative Process, Location and Transportation(LT), Sustainable Sites, Energy and Atmosphere, Water Efficiency, Material and Resources, Indoor
      Environmental Quality, Innovation and Design, and Regional Priority.

      The six mandatory prerequisites are:
    </p>
    <p>• Sustainable Sites: This section has 26 points in total and focuses on the environmental location of the building. Points are awarded according to items ranging from the proximity of the building to Public Transport Accessibility to Bike
      Storage to exterior fixtures</p>
    <p>• Energy and Atmosphere: Of all the categories, this category has the most points, 35 points in total. It focuses on green power, enhanced commissioning, onsite renewable energy, and energy performance of the building</p>
    <p>• Water Efficiency: It is without a doubt that water, like most resources, is finite and with an increase in activities and population, the need for water has greatly increased. This section focuses on the reduction of water and points are
      given based on the reduction of water in toilets, sinks, and sometimes the re-use of greywater.</p>
    <p>• Material Resources: As mentioned earlier in this document, a lot of waste is produced through construction and demolition activities and so this section deals with reducing such waste. Points are awarded based on material reuse, recycling,
      and proper waste management</p>
    <p>• Indoor Environmental Quality: This section focuses on the environment inside a building and the type of products used in the building. Points are awarded for the type of light, ventilation, pollution, and the amount of daylight a building
      has access to.</p>
    <p>• Innovation and Design: Inventive and innovative building strategies that can provide sustainability for buildings are also awarded by LEED. This section focuses on these strategies and is six points in total. </p>
    <p>Based on the number of points achieved, a building earns one of the four LEED ratings: Certified (40-49 points), Silver (50-59 points), Gold (60 – 79 points) and Platinum (80+ points).</p>
