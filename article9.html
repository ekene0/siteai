    <h1>Feasibility Study: Obtaining Electricity from Lightning</h1>

    <h6>ABSTRACT</h6>
    <p>For years, scientists have tried to find a replacement to fossil fuels with the intention of prolonging the earth and at the same time reducing costs. In 2002, there was a suggestion that Lightning could be channeled and used for productive reasons. Is it possible? Theoretically, Lightning consists of current which can be converted to electrical energy. However, a system would need to be put in place. This system would need to be designed in such a way that the charge from the lightning bolt will be directed to a material which would store the charge and convert it to energy for electrical devices, houses, cities, e.t.c. Research and experiments were carried out in order to determine if indeed it were possible to implement this system. The results gotten from these experiments were interesting. However, they could be predicted. </p>

    <h6>INTRODUCTION</h6>
    <p>In 1752, “Benjamin Franklin conducted the first experiment to successfully establish a link between lightning and electricity” (Srinivasan & Gu, 2006, p. 2258). He was able to capture electric charges in a leiden jar via a keychain connected to the silk string of a  kite. This experiment inspired other scientists to conducts similar tests, all confirming Franklin’s discovery (Krider, 2006, p.42). Since then, several attempts have been made by scientists and engineers to understand this naturally occurring phenomenon, and explore its use as a source of electricity. Currently, the world is mostly dependent on fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas to power our homes, vehicles, and other machinery. However, the effects of greenhouse gas emissions from burning these fuels have raised global concerns about the future of the environment, which is justifiable considering the studies on current climate change and how the existence of man, wildlife and agriculture is threatened.
    ß</p>

    <p>Another concern with fossil fuels is their non-renewable nature. This means they do not replenish themselves, so could run out with continued use, which would be difficult to survive if humanity continues to be dependent on this source of energy. To eliminate complete dependence, other sources of energy are being explored and adopted. People are continuously developing the efficiency of solar energy, nuclear energy, wind energy, tidal power, hydropower, and geothermal energy, among others. </p>

    <p>It would appear that harnessing energy from lightning fits perfectly in this category, seeing as all of the other sources listed above are naturally occurring, and do not cause similar levels of damage to the environment as fossil fuels. Regardless, the idea of lightning energy is not widely accepted, since people continue to question its feasibility. The doubts surrounding this topic are understandable, considering the danger and damage caused by lightning every year. It prompts the question of why anyone would want to risk their safety, and functioning equipment. We would look at benefits of this energy source, that have encouraged some researchers to examine the topic regardless of the dangers. Feedback from such endeavours would help to provide a better understanding of why lightning may not be harvestable at the moment.
</p>
<h6>BACKGROUND INFORMATION</h6>
    <p>To further establish the connection between a flash of light and electrical energy, we must first understand how lightning is formed. As explained by Srinivasan & Gu (2006), it begins with the polarization of clouds. That is, charges are separated along the top and bottom (positive charges move to the top and negative charges are repelled to the bottom). They explain further that the high concentration of charges create a strong electric field that causes the air around to be ionized, thereby creating a pathway for charges to flow. The laws of attraction and repulsion cause the earth to release opposite charges. The opposing charges combine to create a path of electrical discharge from the clouds to the earth, viewed as lightning (p. 2259).  The interest in this topic lies in the fact that electric charges which are the fundamental components of electric current, are also the creators of lightning. Also, a bolt single gives off very high amount of energy with currents in thousands of amperes and voltages in billions of volts. To be more precise, “[t]he energy in a lighting strike can reach up to 300,000 amperes and one billion volts, according to the National Weather Service (NWS)” (Gaynor, 2015). This energy is free from nature and is being wasted on the earth. Regardless, the dangerously high power raises questions about the practicality of harnessing lightning for energy. However, due to the foreseeable advantages, it has been considered worth the risk of investigating in the science community.
</p>
    <h6>Why is this energy source important?</h6>
    <p>Imagine a world where it is completely feasible to power our homes during a thunderstorm. It is safe to say that this energy source would be beneficial in ways similar to solar energy. That is, it could be collected at the location where it is needed, saving costs of distribution from power stations. In addition, it falls in line with the pursuit of clean energy as there are no greenhouse emissions. The entire energy source is based on the flow of electrons, as explained earlier. Therefore, unlike fossil fuels that have to be burnt to obtain electricity, the only conversions necessary would be with the aim of adjusting the extremely high voltages and currents to suitably power our devices or machines.
</p>

<h6>Who is it important to?</h6>
<p>Scientists are continuously looking for alternative sources to fossil fuels, whether in fear of being left in a world without power due to their non renewable nature, or fear of climate change due to the greenhouse effect. Either way, multiple areas are being investigated to aid the search, resulting in proposals for biomass, hydrogen gas and so on. Although several possibilities already exist, scientists still need to find the most efficient form that could replace fossil fuels. Also, based on the observation that technology has always developed from the known to the unknown, data from research into this topic could provide more information in the search of the best alternative. Collecting data on the advantages and shortcomings could lead the way to the discovery of a near perfect replacement of fossil fuels. </p>

<p>In the case where a system is developed that proves feasibility of delivering power from the clouds, it would benefit anyone that uses electricity, especially the average person who owns a home, by adopting the similar source-to-user supply of solar power. Solar power works by placing photovoltaic cells on rooftops within the user’s property where sunlight is easily accessed. This eliminates the monthly bills currently paid to electric companies, meaning that the major costs of operation are from installation and maintenance. Similarly, a system based on lightning would depend on nature to supply the source, and the conversion would take place on location, eliminating monthly fees.</p>

<p>Beside the benefits of the derived power, channeling lightning to another use before it hits the earth could reduce cases of destruction of property, injuries and death. According to research supported by Environment Canada, “it is estimated that each year on average in Canada, there are between 9 and 10 lightning-related deaths and up to 164 lightning-related injuries” (Government of Canada, 2016). These numbers would be reduced if the strikes never reach the earth, ensuring safety during thunderstorms.</p>

<h6>EXPERIMENTS AND ANALYSES</h6>
<p>Since it has been established that adopting this energy source would be beneficial to scientists and engineers working on clean energy, property owners, as well as humanity as a whole, it is normal to wonder why methods to harness lightning have not yet been developed. In order to do this, we look at situations where people have conducted experiments to this regard and the conclusions reached.
</p>

<p>A very famous experiment which entailed “using lightning to charge a phone was conducted by Nokia Corp. and scientists from the University of Southampton in September, 2013” (Rachel Graynor 2015). The experiment was performed by using a high-voltage alternating current to pass current through the air, giving off losses of light, sound and heat energy, similar to that of visible lightning. Lightning contains a lot of power, therefore to conduct the experiment, a lot of energy had to be used. The experiment was conducted successfully, giving hope of being able to use alternate energy sources in the future.</p>

<p>It is difficult to control lightning as it is very raw and contains tons of power and energy.  Being very aware of this problem, “ an alternative energy company called Alternate Energy Holdings, Inc. (AEHI) tested a method for capturing the energy in lightning bolts” (Helman 2011). The design of this experiment was inspired by Steve Leroy whom was reportedly able to power a 60-watt light bulb for 20 minutes using energy captured by visual lightning. Moreover, the experiment was implemented using a tower, shunting off a large portion of the incoming energy, and a capacitor to store the energy. However, the experiment was not successful as there was no element or material capable of withstanding and absorbing the power of visible lightning.
</p>

<h6>CHALLENGES</h6>
<p>The benefits highlighted earlier were based on the assumption that this proposition is perfectly adoptable. However, as proven by the experiments, there are several obstacles to real world implementation.</p>
<p>The previously stated advantage of saving distribution costs is not applicable to all locations due to varying of weather patterns across the globe. This means that areas that don’t get a lot of thunderstorms would need to get their supply from nearby areas that do. This reintroduces the cost of distribution.</p>
<p>Like nuclear energy, when something goes wrong it could be catastrophic. If the collection systems fail and lightning is directed to a home with no protection, it could cause damage to property and ultimately, loss of lives. Moreover, there are no suitable materials capable of completely absorbing the current from lightning. This makes it nearly impossible to control the power of lightning without destroying homes and appliances. Furthermore, there are current research programs which come close to finding a solution, however, there are still many complications. It is also difficult to predict whether lightning will be of a positive or negative charge. This means that capacitors will have to be implemented into the mechanical system(lightning collectors) in order to adjust and convert currents. Again, very problematic as regular capacitors are not capable of withstanding the power of lightning. Theoretically, it is possible to design mechanisms that can support lightning charges but the cost of implementation is extremely high. In conclusion, we can safely assume that it would take years to catch up to the level of practicality of fossil fuels.
</p>

<p>Lightning is unpredictable. There is no telling where exactly it would hit at any point in time . Unless a system is created to estimate hit location or channel bolts directly to collection point, only a small percentage of the amount of strikes would deliver energy. Moreover, most of the energy that lightning emits is lost before it comes in contact with the ground, therefore increasing complications. Furthermore, even “if it were possible to contain every single lightning strike in the world, it would only be able to power 8% of the population of the USA”(Kalin 2015).
</p>

<p>Given the high power being collected, if suitable materials are found, the early development would most likely deteriorate quickly, causing even more money to be used for maintenance and replacement. Again, years of research and improvement would be required to enhance the equipment to be both durable and efficient.
</p>

<h6>CONCLUSION</h6>
<p>Although lightning contains a lot of power and energy, it is too expensive to implement and ultimately not practical when comparing its pros to its cons. The world is always evolving and technology advancing exponentially. In conclusion, lightning will continue to be researched and understood in order to maximize its potential in the future. </p>
