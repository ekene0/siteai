    <h1>Machine Learning</h1>

    <h6>Introduction</h6>
    <p>If you have been keeping tabs on the world of technology, you would agree that the phrase, Machine Learning (ML), isn’t just a buzzword anymore but a big and impactful technological advancement in Artificial Intelligence (AI). While AI by
      itself is the science of imitating human skills and abilities, machine learning is a branch of AI that teaches a machine how to learn. In layman’s words, Machine Learning is simply educating/giving machine information so that the machine can
      learn. A lot of scientists in the past have talked about machine learning and even if they didn’t explicitly use the word “Machine Learning”, it was obvious that they referred to the same thing. In 1959, Arthur Samuel, an American pioneer in
      the field of computer gaming and artificial intelligence went on and coined the term, Machine Learning, while at IBM creating a phrase for the many words that have been used in past to describe the term.
    </p>
    <h6>Appplications of Machine Learning in our daily lives</h6>
    <p>
      <h6>1. Social Media Services:</h6> A lot, if not all the social media platforms today utilize machine learning to maximize the interactions and information that can be accessed, viewed and sent on the platform be it from personalizing your
      newsfeed or
      explore page to better ads target. Sometimes, we don’t realize that the reason Facebook continuously provides us with a list of familiar people to connect with is simply because Facebook monitors the accounts we frequent, the people we connect
      with, our interests, our school/workplace and on the basis of continuous learning, they are able to suggest a list of people we most likely know in reality. The same goes for face recognition on Facebook. We upload a picture with friends or
      loved ones and Facebook recognizes the faces of the people in the picture because they use the simple application of Machine Learning to check the unique features and projections in the picture and then match it with someone on your friend
      list. [1]
    </p>
    <p>
      <h6>2. Search Engine Result Refining:</h6> Another application can be seen in search engines like Google, Yahoo, Bing, Baidu, etc. These search engines use Machine Learning to monitor and improve our search results. Each time, we go on the
      internet and
      perform a search, the way we interact and respond to the search results is monitored by algorithms in the backend. This means that if we stay on a page for long, the search engines conclude that the results were appropriate for the search query
      and if we go past the first or second page, the search engines assume the search result wasn’t appropriate for the search query. With Machine
      Learning, these search engines know what we expect to see when we execute a search and with this information, our search results are improved. [1]
    </p>
    <p>
      <h6>3. Product Recommendations:</h6> Have you had this experience where you go online to shop for a product and then you start to see ads online that suit your taste and are similar to the products you’ve gone online to shop for? This is a
      typical
      application of Machine Learning which certainly refines your shopping experience. Based on past purchases, items liked, items put in the cart, online shopping websites frequented and brand preferences, the product suggestions or product ads are
      made to suit our taste. [1]
    </p>
    <p>
      <h6>4. Virtual Assistants:</h6> Virtual assistants like Apple’s Siri and Amazon’s Alexa are able to provide us with whatever information we need like real life assistants. Once activated, you can ask questions like, “What is the weather today”,
      or
      “What is my schedule going to be like today” and so on. You can also instruct these assistants to set alarms or reminders. With constant use, these assistants use machine learning to collect data from your previous involvements and with these
      data, they can provide results and information that are better suited to your preferences. [1]
    </p>
    <h6>Machine Learning Methods</h6>
    <p>In machine learning, there are algorithms or models that represent information for any type of problem. This information is usually in form of raw data and the goal is to go from data to insight. For example, a business man who wants to
      predict sales for upcoming sales period can use machine learning algorithms to predict these sales by observing data from past sales [2]. There are seven different machine learning methods that can be used to make the machine learning concept a
      lot simpler to understand and apply. These methods are:</p>
    <p>• Classification</p>
    <p>• Clustering</p>
    <p>• Regression</p>
    <p>• Dimensionality Reduction</p>
    <p>• Ensemble methods</p>
    <p>• Neural networks and deep learning</p>
    <p>• Transfer Learning</p>
