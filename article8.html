    <h1>Nikola Tesla: The Inventor that Powered the World</h1>
    <h5>Author: Vwede Amrasa</h5>

    <hr>

    <p>There would be no modernization without electricity, and there would be no electricity without the scientists and engineers that dedicated their time to developing electric current. In particular, this report outlines how Nikola Tesla’s
      alternating current motor revolutionized the worldwide generation and transmission of electric power. Nikola Tesla was a Serbian-American inventor, physicist, and engineer. Although he is known for his valuable contributions to robotics, radio,
      wireless communications, and x-rays, his electric motor is the most significant to modern day electrical engineering. Before his invention, Direct Current (DC) was the primary source of electricity. DC allows high power dissipation; therefore
      it requires power stations to be located about a mile away from the receivers, making the system costly and inefficient. Alternating Current (AC) is better than DC because it allows voltage to be stepped up and down, resulting in minimized
      energy losses caused by heating of the cables that transport electricity over long distances. AC motors are still used today, because they positively transformed the field of electrical engineering.</p>

    <p>Tesla’s childhood was significant to making him a pioneer. He lived with an intelligent father, who could recite lengthy pieces of literature in several languages, and a creative mother, who “was renowned for her ingenuity, and designed and
      built many of the appliances in her home. Tesla often credited his mother for endowing him, both genetically and by experience, with his remarkable creativity” (Gunderman & Alavanja, 2015, p.5). This is evident when we observe the talent
      that shines through his multiple inventions. Records show that he “had 700 patents in the United States and Europe that covered every aspect of science and technology” (Roguin, 2004, p.369). These patents contained designs that he envisioned
      and analyzed in his mind before building them. The impressive record shows that Tesla had a creative mind that can be attributed to his background. He grew up observing how his father used his mind to store information and how his mother used
      her mind to create solutions to problems by bringing her ideas to life. Also, Tesla’s parents probably engaged him in intellectual conversations that led him to think creatively. Young engineers today would have a higher of chance of excelling
      if they surround themselves with intelligent peers and experienced scientists or engineers that would challenge them to develop new skills and apply scientific knowledge in everyday interaction. A lifestyle of scientific conversations or
      debates would equip their knowledge base with information needed to identify real world problems and develop innovative solutions.</p>
    </p>
    <p>As explained by Schmorrow & Schmorrow (2015), Tesla’s interest in AC was sparked during a University physics lesson. A Gramme Dynamo (a DC generator) was brought to the class. The dynamo used a commutator (component that changes AC to DC by
      rotating the core) to induce current. Tesla observed that the dynamo could work without a commutator, therefore generating usable AC power without converting. The professor did not agree with Tesla’s observation and dedicated the rest of the
      class to proving him wrong. Tesla was not discouraged, but became determined to prove his theory was right. His determination paid off, as after four years, he came up with the idea of an AC motor that produced current without a commutator or a
      dynamo, but a rotating magnetic field instead (p.184). Tesla’s encounter with his professor illustrates that professional engineers are not able to develop their ideas because they do not have the support of people in authority or people they
      look up to. Tesla’s professor was clearly more experienced than him but was not as creative. Since the professor believed in the validity of the current generator, he was not open to challenging the system like Tesla was. Similarly, young or
      professional engineers may notice areas of improvement or change in engineering principles, old devices, or new designs being developed. They may try to express their concerns like Tesla did, only to be proved wrong by professors, mentors, or
      bosses. The best decision would be to trust their instincts, and maintain persistence in finding the solution to the observed issue, no matter how long it takes. Suppressing creativity would lead to a life of what-ifs. Assuming Tesla had
      allowed the professor to shut him down, he would not have developed the AC motor, and would have wondered how different the world would be if he had acted on his instincts.
    </p>

    <p>Implementing the new AC system was not easy, and the professor’s discouraging words were the first of many obstacles. Tesla needed to get funding to bring the design to life, so he travelled to the United States where inventors were valued,
      and investors were generous. He also wanted to meet Thomas Edison, who he looked up to. He arrived in New York with a recommendation letter from a former employer and a few pennies in his possession, to ask for a job and explain his plans for
      the AC motor. Thomas Edison was at the forefront of DC power, so he was not willing to explore Tesla’s opposing AC system. Tesla was granted a job however, and was promised a $50,000 reward to improve the electrical systems at Edison’s company.
      When he completed the job and requested his payment, Edison dismissed him for not understanding American humor. He then quit his job and moved on from Edison’s company (Gunderman & Alavanja, 2015; Roguin, 2004; Schmorrow & Schmorrow, 2015).
      Meeting Edison turned out to be a disappointment, but Tesla did not take that as a sign to return home. Instead he stayed to form his own company called 'The Tesla Electric Light & Manufacturing Company of Rahway, New Jersey'. This
      disappointingly, did not last long and he had to work in road construction to survive (Jarvis, 1969). Tesla faced three setbacks in a row, but kept trying because he was determined to create his AC motor. He also knew that unfortunate
      situations do not last forever. Engineers may choose to take risks in their careers by investing most of their resources into developing new technology or by leaving a job they are not comfortable with. The technology may fail the first time or
      they may not get a better job after the first few tries, so adopting Tesla’s resilience is the only way to ensure all of the failure builds towards a success story.
    </p>

    <p>Eventually, life got better for Tesla when George Westinghouse –inventor of rail road air brakes, and owner of Westinghouse corporation- heard about his work with AC motors. Since George Westinghouse had been interested in adopting AC for
      power distribution, he decided to look into Tesla’s motors. He then bought the patents from Tesla and employed his company resources to develop the system. The motors were not completely feasible at first, until the Westinghouse team made some
      adjustments to the original design (Friedlander, 1972). Tesla was fortunate to find Westinghouse, who shared his vision and possessed the resources to develop the system. Realizing an innovation requires support from people with similar goals.
      Westinghouse ensured that the AC motors worked because he equally wanted to discover the possibility of AC power. If Edison had begrudgingly agreed to implement Tesla’s motors, Edison would have dropped the project at the first sign of risk,
      discouraging other companies from taking interest in Tesla’s motors. Innovative scientists and engineers should partner with people who believe in the importance of their invention, as they would pursue the process from the prototype to the
      final product. Also, the support from the Westinghouse team helped to identify improvements to the system. Team work is important in engineering design; people employ their diverse opinions, ideas, and experiences to identify and make up for
      each other’s shortcomings. We may credit the idea to Tesla, but the final product was a result of team work between Tesla and the engineers at Westinghouse Corporation.
    </p>

    <p>Before this breakthrough was accepted by the world, Tesla and Westinghouse got the opportunity to prove the superiority of AC motors to DC in power generation and transmission. At the time, Thomas Edison’s DC generators were the primary source
      of electricity. During the Columbian exposition in 1893, Tesla’s invention contended with Edison’s. The AC generator lit up the venue with beautiful, bright lights (Roguin, 2004, p.372). Roguin notes that system gained mass approval during the
      exposition and became the first to power Niagara falls by stating, “[t]he Niagara power plant proved the workability of Tesla’s polyphase system of AC and established the kind of power system that would eventually be used throughout the United
      States and the world” (Roguin, 2004, p.372). This shows the universality, and timelessness of Tesla’s AC motor, whose concept is applied to harnessing power from Niagara falls till this day.
    </p>

    <p>
      Tesla’s motor built on the existing concept of power generation, proving that the best inventions can also be improvements to existing mechanisms. Engineers must not discover their own principles to change the world. Simply identifying
      improvements to existing designs could dramatically improve how well the problem is solved. Smartphones are another example. The mobile phone was invented to improve communication. As technology advanced, the basic principles behind mobile
      phones were retained in smartphones, but emailing and instant messaging were added to further simplify communication and create better user experiences. Although Nikola Tesla was not solely responsible for discovering the concept of AC or
      motors, we commend him for applying his creativity to revolutionizing electricity transmission.
    </p>

    <p>
      Tesla’s success can be credited to his selfless passion for innovation, evident by the 700 patents he acquired in his lifetime. He never married, and spent most of his life alone, working on new projects. Although engineers are not encouraged
      to be reclusive, caring about the problems they are trying to solve is essential; simply remembering the goal would provide motivation through difficult times. Tesla was motivated to implement his motor even after he was tricked by Edison, lost
      a company, and became a construction worker. He was also able to endure the difficulty because none of his inventions were driven by the monetary benefits. Tesla did not claim all the royalties he deserved for his inventions, and as a result,
      became poor and lived off pensions in his old age. According to Gunderman & Alavanja (2015), he received a compensation and agreed to give up the royalties from Westinghouse to save them from a financial crisis, “[c]haracteristically, Tesla
      invested his share in the pursuit of further innovation” (p.6). He forfeited a lifetime supply of income and prioritized science over his comfort.
    </p>

    <p>
      Tesla’s solitary behavior and disinterest in a wealthy lifestyle allowed him to concentrate on producing quality work. Minimizing distractions generates the optimum focus necessary for working on any project, innovative or not. Concentrating on
      one activity is difficult today due to social media and constant activity on smart devices. Our attention spans are shortened, and multitasking is encouraged. This does not allow a person explore their creativity and produce their best work.
      Constantly engaging the mind with trivial matters leaves no room for deep thought. Engineers and scientists could encourage innovation by disconnecting from digital entertainment and social media during work hours.

      Leaving his comfort zone also contributed to the quality of his work. When Tesla left his home to achieve his goal, the standards were raised; he had to be sure his idea was worth fighting for before enduring all the setbacks. Failure in a
      foreign country is less secure as there are limited safe alternatives. People could leave their comfort zones as a source of motivation to fully realize their potential. The unfamiliarity of a new environment provides an additional drive for
      excellence.

      The invention of the motor was well received because it met people’s needs. AC motors provided an energy efficient and cost effective alternative to DC generators. As a result, power stations, companies, and home owners were not hesitant to
      switch over. Engineers should remember that projects driven by user satisfaction are the most successful. If the AC motor did not offer a better lifestyle, the invention would have been ignored.

      Despite all the obstacles Tesla faced, including disapproving professors and colleagues as well as lack of resources, he kept his dream alive and did not stop trying till he saw his AC motor come to life. His attitude is exemplary for all
      scientists and engineers, because his passion driven, resilient lifestyle allowed him to create an invention so relevant, that it has not been overshadowed by advancement in technology; the same concepts are still in use today. Even after his
      AC motors were fully functional, Nikola Tesla went on to conduct several more experiments and spent his lifetime inventing and filing patents. He worked on wireless communications, x-rays, radio, towards improving humanity. He would always be
      remembered as one of the most valuable personalities in electrical engineering.
