    <h1>The Internet of Things (IoT) Explained</h1>

    <h6>Introduction</h6>
    <p>With the rise of technology and the internet in the 21st century, words like IoT have gained popularity amongst scientists, technologists and normal people alike but what exactly is IoT? Before we go into the definition of IoT, let’s take a
      look at a little history of the phrase, Internet of Things. The term, Internet of Things, was first coined by British Technologist, Kevin Ashton, in 1999 but the idea of the Internet of Things goes back a lot further.

      In the year 1926, Nikola Tesla predicted the Internet of Things in an interview he had with Colliers Magazine and his exact words were: “When wireless is perfectly applied the whole earth will be converted into a huge brain, which in fact it
      is, all things being particles of a real and rhythmic whole.  We shall be able to communicate with one another instantly, irrespective of distance.  Not only this, but through television and telephony we shall see and hear one another as
      perfectly as though we were face to face, despite intervening distances of thousands of miles; and the instruments through which we shall be able to do this will be amazingly simple compared with our present telephone.  A man will be able to
      carry one in his vest pocket [1].” Another scientist to delve into the topic of the internet of things long before the internet was developed is Alan Turing who in 1950 stated the possibility of machines communicating with one another.
      After the onset of the internet in 1969 and the connection of the first toaster to the internet in 1990, things began to accelerate. IBM developed a Machine-to-Machine protocol in 1999 called MQ Telemetry Transport which is known to have
      prompted the connectivity amongst more devices and in 2000, LG designed the Smart Refrigerator which has been one of the major examples of the Internet of Things today [2].
    </p>
    <h6>What is IOT and how does it work?</h6>
    <p>Explaining the term internet of things to a layman can be as simple as describing it as the connection of devices without human interaction to form a system and this is in fact, correct. Nevertheless, the formal definition of the internet of
      things is a system of interrelated computing devices, mechanical and digital machines, objects, animals, or people that are provided with UID (Unique Identifiers) and the ability to transfer data over a network without requiring human-to-human
      or human-to-computer interaction [3]
      In IoT, the connection can span through various devices such as cellphones, cars, lamps, toasters, washing machines, and almost any device you can think of [3].


      Knowing what IoT means is one thing, and knowing how the interconnectivity of the IoT platform works is another. The working mechanism of the Internet of Things is based on the connection of devices with built in sensors to an IoT platform
      which goes on to fuse data from different devices and share the information which is seen as the most important with applications designed to meet/address certain needs [4]. These platforms have the ability to decipher useful information and
      ignore unnecessary information and the useful information is then used to detect recurring patterns and even predict problems before they occur [4].

    </p>
    <h6>Importance of IoT</h6>
    <p>It goes without saying that IoT is growing in importance both for use in industries and use in our daily lives. The world of technology has been greatly impacted by the numerous benefits of IoT and the advancements that the internet of things
      has provided through its platforms so saying that IoT is the most important development of the 21st century would be absolutely true. Now what are the positive impacts and importance of IoT?

      Let’s start from our daily lives. From time to time, we make use of virtual assistants like Amazon’s Alex and Apple’s Siri to provide us with information such as the weather, news, time, and even music at moments when it is less convenient for
      us to reach for our phones or computers and access this information. In recent time, there has been an advancement in smart locks and smart doorbells such that your phones are connected to these smart locks and you are notified whenever a human
      temperature or imminent security threat is sensed anywhere around these locks. Also, a lot of people see fitness as everything, and being able to track daily fitness progress is important. This is where smart devices such as fitness trackers
      and smart scale come into place and all these devices right from the virtual assistants to the smart locks and smart doorbells to the smart scale and the fitness trackers are products of the Internet of Things.

      The importance of IoT doesn’t stop there, it extends to industries, businesses and consumer-manufacturer relationships. According to research, 60% of global manufacturers make use of analytics data gotten via the interconnectivity of devices to
      scrutinize processes and predict optimization possibilities. These manufactures are able to not just keep track of but also automate the numerous processes involved in manufacturing [5]. IoT is also important in the aspect of quality control
      and thereby improve customer satisfaction. IoT sensors collect data about customer sentiments on products and analyze these data to identify and correct quality and product issues. The importance of IoT in industries and in our daily lives in
      enormous and even at times when we do not realize it, IoT helps us work smarter, live smarter and gain proper control of our lives.
