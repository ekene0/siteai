    <h1>The Artificial Intelligence of Things</h1>

    <h6>Introduction</h6>
    <p>AIoT means Artificial Intelligence of Things, this a new trend in technology and engineering that combines two very powerful trends into a fully new and exciting field, these trends are Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT).  Artificial intelligence is when a system can complete a set of tasks or learn from data in a way that seems intelligent [1]. The Internet of Things can be explained as when “things” such as wearable devices, refrigerators, digital assistants, sensors and other equipment are connected to the internet, can be recognized by other devices and collect and process data [1]. These two concepts can therefore be combined, when artificial intelligence is added to the internet of things it allows for these devices to analyze data and make decisions and act on that data automatically.

<h6>AIoT in Building Science
</h6>

<p>The process of making devices or places smarter is centered around adding sensors and other data acquisition features in order to get a sense of the trend of activities unique to the devices or spaces. A new area where artificial intelligence and the internet of things are combined is in smart office spaces. In some companies, they have chosen to install a network of smart environmental transducers or sensors in their office space. These sensors are used to detect what personnel are present and adjust temperatures, lighting and other environmental parameters accordingly to improve energy efficiency of the building. Another interesting case is presented in smart buildings controlling building access through facial recognition technology. A network of interconnected cameras and artificial intelligence that can compare images taken in real-time against a database to determine whether access should be granted or denied to a building is AIoT in full display. In a similar way, employees wouldn't need to clock in, or attendance for mandatory meetings wouldn't have to be completed since the AIoT system takes care of it [1]. The addition of AIoT to the design of any building only makes for a more energy-efficient and greener design.
